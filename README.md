A tool for unfollowing inactive people on Twitter.

A personal, for fun side project to play with the Tweepy API and PySide.

You must provide your own Twitter authorization tokens. Create a `.twitter_keys.json` file in the /resources folder. The keys file must resemble the following:

    {
        "consumer_key": "abc",
        "consumer_secret": "def",
        "access_token": "123-abc",
        "access_secret": "1a2b3c",
        "user_name": "you"
    }
